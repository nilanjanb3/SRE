# SRE
This repo is made to document SRE Practices.

1. **Service Level Objectives (SLOs):**
   - Define and measure specific performance targets for a service, setting expectations for reliability.

2. **Service Level Indicators (SLIs) and Service Level Agreements (SLAs):**
   - Identify measurable indicators of service performance (SLIs) and establish commitments to maintain specific levels of service (SLAs).

3. **Error Budgets:**
   - Use error budgets to quantify the acceptable level of service degradation, allowing a balance between reliability and innovation.

4. **Automation:**
   - Emphasize automation for repetitive operational tasks to reduce manual intervention and minimize the risk of human error.

5. **Monitoring and Alerting:**
   - Implement robust monitoring systems to track system health and performance. Set up effective alerting mechanisms to notify teams of potential issues.

6. **Incident Response and Management:**
   - Develop and practice incident response processes to quickly detect, mitigate, and resolve service disruptions. Conduct post-incident reviews for learning.

7. **Capacity Planning:**
   - Analyze and plan for the capacity needs of systems to ensure they can handle expected loads and scale appropriately.

8. **Performance Optimization:**
   - Continuously optimize the performance of systems by identifying bottlenecks, addressing inefficiencies, and making necessary improvements.

9. **Emergency Response Drills:**
   - Conduct regular drills and simulations to prepare the team for handling emergency situations and ensuring a swift response to incidents.

10. [**Change Management:**](./docs/CHANGE_MANAGEMENT.md)
    - Implement a structured change management process to assess and manage the risk associated with software releases and infrastructure changes.

11. **Blameless Post-Mortems:**
    - Encourage a blame-free culture during post-incident reviews to focus on identifying root causes and implementing preventive measures.

12. **Reliability Reviews:**
    - Perform reliability reviews of new services or major changes to assess their impact on system reliability and suggest improvements.

13. **Cultural Aspects:**
    - Foster a culture of collaboration between development and operations teams, breaking down silos and promoting shared responsibility for reliability.

14. **Documentation:**
    - Maintain comprehensive documentation for systems, processes, and configurations to facilitate knowledge sharing and onboarding of new team members.

15. **On-Call Practices:**
    - Establish on-call rotations with well-defined roles and responsibilities to ensure 24/7 coverage for critical systems.
